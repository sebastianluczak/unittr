## Goals:
- Universal Time Tracker

- Be able to integrate back and forth with time trackers (Toggl, Harvest)
- Be able to integrate back with task trackers (Jira, Trello etc.)
- Common CLI interface
- Able to connect to API
- self hosted (free, docker provided) or in cloud (in future, paid option?)
- Open-Source as much as possible

## PRE-MORTEM

### Threads
- not much time on my hands to deal with it alone
